## üßπ Data Preparation & Cleaning Highlights (`01_zepto_data_preparation.sql`)

This script demonstrates foundational data governance skills:

* **Schema & Table Creation:** Defining the table structure (`CREATE TABLE`) with appropriate data types for the raw data.
* **Unit Conversion:** Applying arithmetic operations (`/ 100.0`) to convert the price columns (`mrp`, `discountedSellingPrice`) from **paise to rupees** for consistency and accurate analysis.
* **Data Validation:** Identifying and **removing invalid records** where the discounted selling price or MRP was zero.
* **Data Integrity:** Checking the dataset for **NULL values** and addressing potential duplicates.

## üìà Analysis & Insights Highlights (`02_zepto_analysis_queries.sql`)

This script focuses on extracting actionable business intelligence from the cleaned data:

* **Revenue Estimation:** Calculating the total estimated revenue generated per **product category**.
* **Value-for-Money Ranking:** Calculating the **price per gram** metric to standardize comparison across different products and identify best value.
* **Discount Strategy Evaluation:** Identifying the top product categories that are offering the **highest average discount percentage**.
* **Pricing Margin Assessment:** Filtering for products with **high MRP** but minimal discount to analyze potential high-margin items.
* **Inventory Segmentation:** Using **`CASE` statements** to categorize products into custom weight segments (e.g., Low, Medium, Bulk) for inventory management.
